;; NOTE: this is needed because depending on the type of the build and
;; target execution evironment (browser, esm), the real export can be
;; different. All this issue is about the commonjs and esm
;; interop/conversion, because the js ecosystem decided that is should
;; work this way.
;;
;; In this concrete case, lodash exposes commonjs module which works
;; ok on browser build but for ESM build it is converted in the best
;; effort to esm module, exporting the module.exports as the default
;; property. This is why on ESM builds we need to look on .-default
;; property.
