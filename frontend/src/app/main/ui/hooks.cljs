;; The dnd API is problematic for nested elements, such a sortable items tree.
;; The approach used here to solve bad situations is:
;; - Capture all events in the leaf draggable elements, and stop propagation.
;; - Ignore events originated in non-draggable children.
;; - At drag operation end, all elements that have received some enter/over
;;   event and have not received the corresponding leave event, are notified
;;   so they can clean up. This can be occur, for example, if
;;    * some leave events are throttled out because of a slow computer
;;    * some corner cases of mouse entering a container element, and then
;;      moving into a contained element. This is anyway mitigated by not
;;      stopping propagation of leave event.
;;
;; Do not remove commented out lines, they are useful to debug events when
;; things go weird.
