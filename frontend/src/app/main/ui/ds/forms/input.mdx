# Input

The `input*` component is a wrapper to the HTML `<input>` element with custom styling
and additional elements that adds context and, in some cases, adds extra
functionality.

<Canvas of={InputStories.Default} />


## Technical notes

### Icons

`input*` accepts an `icon` prop, which must contain an [icon ID](../foundations/assets/icon.mdx).
These are available in the `app.main.ds.foundations.assets.icon` namespace.

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))
```

```clj
[:> input* {:icon i/effects}]
```

<Canvas of={InputStories.WithIcon} />

## Usage guidelines (design)

### Where to use

In forms where the user needs to input any short text or number.

### When to use

When the information that is needed is short and needs an element to add context
for using it or additional functionality (like color picker).

### Size

The width of the component depends on the content and layout. They can expand to
fill the container or the content area to which they relate (e.g. tabs) and adapt
depending on whether there are one or two input elements with or without buttons
next to them. Their height is always fixed, `32px`, with text area being used for
larger text blocks.
