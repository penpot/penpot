# PanelTitle

The `panel-title*` is used as a header for some sidebar sections.

<Canvas of={PanelTitle.Default} />

## Technical notes

The only mandatory parameter is `text`. Usually you'll want to pass a function property `on-close` that will be called when the user clicks on the close button on the right.

```clj
[:> panel-title* {:class class
                  :text text
                  :on-close on-close}]
```
