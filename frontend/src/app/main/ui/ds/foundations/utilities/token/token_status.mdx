# Token status icons

## Technical notes

There are some SVG that are not regular icons, and that are only
meant to be used on token components.

They represent the applied status of a token over a shape.

The assets are located in the `frontend/resources/images/icons` folder.

### Using asset IDs

For convenience, icons IDs are available in the component namespace.

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.utilities.token.token-status :refer [token-status-icon*] :as ts]))
```

```clj
[:> token-status-icon*
        {:icon-id ts/token-status-partial
         :class (stl/css :token-pill-icon)}]
```
