# Iconography

See the [list of all available icons](?path=/story/foundations-assets-icon--all).

## Variants

### Medium (default)

- Used in the majority of the interface, and **it is the default variant**.
- Displayed within a box of 16×16 pixels.
- 1 px stroke (centered).

This is enabled with `size` prop set to `"m"`.

### Small

- Displayed within a box of 16×16 pixels.
- Bigger padding (4 pixels)
- Best used when the space is limited. Use in components such text inputs os in
dense interfaces such layers or chevrons to indicate a collapsible element.

This is enabled with `size` prop set to `"s"`.

## Technical notes

### Using icons IDs

There are icon ID definitions you can use in your code rather than typing the
icon ID by hand.

**Using these IDs is recommended**, since they are invariant to the icon asset
filename.

Assuming the namespace is required as `i`:

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))
```

You can now use the icon IDs defined in the namespace:

```clj
[:> i/icon* {:icon-id i/pin}]
```

### Customizing colors

Icon color is set internally with the `stroke` property and it's set to
`currentColor` by default.

If you need to override this behavior, you can use a `class` in the `<Icon>`
component and set `color` to whatever value you prefer:

```clj
[:> i/icon* {:icon-id i/add :class (stl/css :toolbar-icon)}]
```

```scss
.toolbar-icon {
  color: var(--component-toolbar-icon-color);
}
```

### Accessibility

By default, icons do not have any accessible text attached to them. You should
add an `aria-label` attribute to set a proper text:

```clj
[:> i/icon* {:icon-id i/add :aria-label (tr "foo.bar")}]
```

## Usage guidelines for design

### Layout

Icon content should remain inside of the live area. In specific icons that need
to adjust visual weight, content may extend into the padding between live area
and trim area, never outside the trim area.

### Color

Icons are normally displayed with the chromatic characteristics of the component
in which they are included. They are normally based on foreground and neutral
colours, but may also, in some cases, be displayed in semantic colours when
their function is to accompany system status messages.

### Accessibility

Icons must meet the contrast requirement.

They should be designed with the correct transmission of the concept they
communicate in mind, reviewing cultural and generational differences to avoid
comprehension problems.
