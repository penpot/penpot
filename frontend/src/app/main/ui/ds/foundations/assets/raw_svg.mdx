# SVG Assets

## Technical notes

There are some SVG assets that are not icons or cursors, and that are mostly
meant to be used as is (although depending on the context, some will be required
to be used with a specific color or size).

The assets are located in the `frontend/resources/images/assets` folder.

### Using asset IDs

For convenience, asset IDs are available in the component namespace.

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.raw-svg :as svg]))
```

```clj
[:> svg/raw-svg* {:asset svg/logo}]
```
