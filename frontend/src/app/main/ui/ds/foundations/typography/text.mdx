### Using typography IDs

There are typography ID definitions you can use in your code rather than typing the
typography ID by hand.

**Using these IDs is recommended**.

Assuming the namespace of the typography is required as `t`:

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.typography :as t]
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.typography.text :refer [text*]]))
```

You can now use the typography IDs defined in the namespace:

```clj
[:> text* {:typography t/title-large :as "p"} "Welcome to Penpot"]
```
