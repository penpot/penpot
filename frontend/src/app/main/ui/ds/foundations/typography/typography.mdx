# Typography

We currently work with 3 scales depending on whether the typography
is applied in the workspace, in the dashboard and access areas
and in the communication modalities.

This situation is something to be corrected in future improvements.

## Usage

### Standard text colours

Typographic colours are used in text elements such as headers
and body and in the various components that make up the tool...

The colours used in typography are the Foreground colours such
`--color-foreground-primary` or `--color-foreground-secondary`
but different colours can be applied in specific component
applications with their own styles, such as buttons.

As far as possible and as long as accessibility is not affected,
we will use colour in typography as a way of hierarchising
the content displayed using tone, built in luminance changes and
size as differentiating elements between main and secondary text.

### Status text colous

Another possible application of colour is semantic, when we use text to convey some system state.

Use the tokens:

`--color-accent-success` - Use as text colour to indicate success.

`--color-accent-warning` - Use as text colour to indicate a warning or caution.

`--color-accent-error` - Use as text colour to indicate an error.


## Accesibility

Typefaces should be sized for legibility and accessibility.
The minimum size for texts in Penpot will be 14px except
for exceptions based on the size of the components.

## Title

### Display `display`

Hero style text for transitional pages (Login). If too large use large title in narrow windows.

<Canvas of={TextStories.Display} />

### Title Large `title-large`

Page headers for main pages (dashboard, Profiles...). If too big use title
(medium) in narrow windows.

<Canvas of={TextStories.TitleLarge} />

### Title Medium `title-medium`

Default page title. Equivalent line height of 32px matches the height
of buttons and other medium controls. Ideal for page header layout.

<Canvas of={TextStories.TitleMedium} />

### Title Small `title-small`

Uses the same size as body (large).

<Canvas of={TextStories.TitleSmall} />

## Headline

Page sections/subtitles, or names of less important objects in page titles
(automated action titles, for example). Same line height as title (medium).

### Headline Large `headline-large`

<Canvas of={TextStories.HeadlineLarge} />

### Headline Medium `headline-medium`

<Canvas of={TextStories.HeadlineMedium} />

### Headline small `headline-small`

<Canvas of={TextStories.HeadlineSmall} />

## Body

### Body large `body-large`

Generic content.

<Canvas of={TextStories.BodyLarge} />

### Body medium `body-medium`

Default UI font. Most commonly used for body text.

<Canvas of={TextStories.BodyMedium} />

### Body small `body-small`

Small compact font with a line height of less than 16px.
Use for single line scenarios, as the small size does not meet accessibility requirements.

<Canvas of={TextStories.BodySmall} />

## Code font `code-font`

Default style for rendering code blocks.

<Canvas of={TextStories.CodeFont} />

## Fonts

We are using 3 fonts

- The default font family is `Work Sans`. It was chosen for its efficiency and legibility.
- In case of having the interface in Farsi or Arabic this font will be replaced by `Vazirmatn`.
- For code blocks we are useng `Roboto Mono`.
