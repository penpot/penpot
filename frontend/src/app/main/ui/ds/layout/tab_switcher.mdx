# Tab Switcher

Tabbed interfaces are a way of navigating between multiple panels, 
reducing clutter and fitting more into a smaller space.

## Variants

**Icon + Text**, we will use this variant when there is plenty of space 
and an icon can help to understand the tab content quickly. 
Use it only when icons add real value, to avoid too much noise in the UI.

**Text**, we will use this variant when there are enough space and icons don't add any useful context.

<Canvas of={TabSwitcher.Default} />

**Icon**, we will use this variant in small spaces, when an icon is enough hint to understand the tab content.
<Canvas of={TabSwitcher.WithIcons} />

**With action button**, we can add an action button to the begining or ending of the tab nav. 
This button must be configured and styled outside of the component.

## Technical notes

### Icons

Each tab of `tab_switcher*` accept an `icon`, which must contain an [icon ID](../foundations/assets/icon.mdx).
These are available in the `app.main.ds.foundations.assets.icon` namespace.


```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))
```

```clojure
(let [selected-tab* (mf/use-state "code")
      selected-tab  (deref selected-tab*)
      on-change-tab (mf/use-fn #(reset! selected-tab* %))
      tabs          (mf/with-memo []
                      [{:label "Code"
                        :id "code"
                        :icon i/fill-content}
                       {:label "Design"
                        :id "design"
                        :icon i/pentool}
                       {:label "Menu"
                        :id "menu"
                        :icon i/mask}])]
  [:> tab_switcher* {:tabs tabs
                     :selected selected-tab
                     :on-change on-change-tab}
   (case selected-tab
     "code"
     [:p "Lorem Ipsum"]

     "design"
     [:p "Dolor sit amet"]

     "menu"
     [:p "Consectetur adipiscing elit"])])

```

<Canvas of={TabSwitcher.WithIconsAndText} />

### Paddings

We have the option to define `paddings` for tab nav from outside the component to fit all needs. In order to do so
we will create, on the parent, this variables with the desired `value`. 

```scss
.parent {
    --tabs-nav-padding-inline-start: value;
    --tabs-nav-padding-inline-end: value;
    --tabs-nav-padding-block-start: value;
    --tabs-nav-padding-block-end: value;
}
```

### Accessibility

A tab  with icons only on a `tab_switcher*` require an `aria-label`. This is also shown in a tooltip on hovering the tab.

```clj
[:> tab_switcher*       
    {:tabs [{ :aria-label "Code"
              :id "tab-code"
              :icon i/fill-content
              :content [:p Lorem Ipsum ]}
            { :aria-label "Design"
              :id "tab-design"
              :icon i/pentool
              :content [:p Dolor sit amet ]}
            { :aria-label "Menu"
              :id "tab-menu"
              :icon i/mask
              :content [:p Consectetur adipiscing elit ]} 
            ]}]
```

<Canvas of={TabSwitcher.WithIcons} />

## Usage guidelines (design)

### Where to use

In panels where we want to show elements that are related but are 
different or have different goals, or that are in the same hierarchy level.

### When to use

Used when we need to display in the same space a full complex views of related elements.

### Interaction / Behavior

On click, switch the tab content.
Tabs with icons only should display a tooltip on hover.

In the event that the content of the tabs, due to language changes, 
modifies its length and does not fit within the tab sizes, the tabs 
will adapt to the content, trying to display it in full and reducing 
the size of the other tabs when possible.
