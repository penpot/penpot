# Notifications

`toast*` and `context-notification` accept a `level` prop to indicate the type of message. If this prop is `nil`,
the default variant will be shown:

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Default} />

Info:

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Info} />

Warning:

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Warning} />

Error:

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Error} />

Success:

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Success} />

## Toasts

Toast notifications are temporary floating elements that provide information
that requires user acknowledgement.

### Usage guidelines (design)

#### Where to use

Displayed in the top right corner of the page, in absolute position.

#### When to use

When the notification is temporary and is related or affects the whole context
of the page the user is viewing or interacting with.
