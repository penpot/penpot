# Select

Select lets users choose one option from an options menu.

## Variants

**Text**: We will use this variant when there are enough space and icons don't add any useful context.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Default} />

**Icon and text**: We will use this variant when there are enough space and icons add any useful context.
<Canvas of={SelectStories.WithIcons} />

## Technical notes

### Icons

Each option of `select*` may accept an `icon`, which must contain an [icon ID](../foundations/assets/icon.mdx).
These are available in the `app.main.ds.foundations.assets.icon` namespace.


```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))
```

```clj
[:> select*       
    {:options [{ :label "Code"
                 :id "option-code"
                 :icon i/fill-content }
               { :label "Design"
                 :id "option-design"
                 :icon i/pentool }
               { :label "Menu"
                 :id "option-menu" } 
               ]}]
```

## Usage guidelines (design)

### Where to use

Used in a wide range of applications in the app, 
to select among available text-based options, 
sometimes with icons that offers additional context.

### When to use

Consider using select when you have 5 or more options to choose from.

### Interaction / Behavior

When the user clicks on the clickable area, a list of 
options appears. When an option is chosen, the list is closed.
