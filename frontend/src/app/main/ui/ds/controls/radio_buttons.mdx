# Radio Buttons

The `radio-buttons*` component allows users to switch between two or more options that are mutually exclusive.

## Variants

Radio buttons with text only. The label will be the text of the button.

<Canvas of={RadioButtons.Default} />

```clj
[:> radio-buttons* {:selected "left"
                    :on-change handle-change
                    :name "alignment"
                    :extended false
                    :allow-empty false
                    :options [{:id "align-left"
                               :label "Left"
                               :value "left"}
                              {:id "align-center"
                               :label "Center"
                               :value "center"}
                              {:id "align-right"
                               :label "Right"
                               :value "right"}]}]
```

Radio buttons with icons only. In this case, the label will act as the tooltip of each button.

<Canvas of={RadioButtons.WithIcons} />

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))

[:> radio-buttons* {:selected "left"
                    :on-change handle-change
                    :name "alignment"
                    :extended false
                    :allow-empty false
                    :options [{:id "align-left"
                               :icon i/text-align-left
                               :label "Left align"
                               :value "left"}
                              {:id "align-center"
                               :icon i/text-align-center
                               :label "Center align"
                               :value "center"}
                              {:id "align-right"
                               :icon i/text-align-right
                               :label "Right align"
                               :value "right"}]}]
```

## Anatomy

Under the hood, each option is represented by
- a button, which is the visible and clickable element. It may be either an icon button or a text button.
- a radio input, which is not visible but retains the current state of the option.

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same name. Once a radio group is established,
selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group.

The `selected` parameter should be set to the value of the option that is to be active. Otherwise, no option will be selected.

If the parameter `allow-empty` is enabled, then the component will work with checkboxes instead of radio buttons,
and therefore the selected option can be deselected. However, it will still only be possible to select one option.

The `extended` parameter allows the component to use all the available space from the parent and distribute it equally
among all elements.

Any option can be individually disabled using the `disabled` parameter.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- For multiple choice settings that take effect immediately.
- In preference panels and configuration screens.

### When Not to Use

- For boolean settings (use switch or checkbox instead).
- For actions that require confirmation (use buttons instead).
- For temporary states that need explicit "Apply" action.
