# Combobox

Combobox lets users choose one option from an options menu or enter a custom value that is not listed in the menu. It combines the functionality of a dropdown menu and an input field, allowing for both selection and free-form input.

## Variants

**Text**: We will use this variant when there are enough space and icons don't add any useful context.

## Technical notes

### Icons

Each option of `combobox*` may accept an `icon`, which must contain an [icon ID](../foundations/assets/icon.mdx).
These are available in the `app.main.ds.foundations.assets.icon` namespace.

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.foundations.assets.icon :as i]))
```

```clj
[:> combobox*
    {:options [{ :label "Code"
                 :id "option-code"
                 :icon i/fill-content }
               { :label "Design"
                 :id "option-design"
                 :icon i/pentool }
               { :label "Menu"
                 :id "option-menu" }
               ]}]
```

## Usage guidelines (design)

### Where to Use

Combobox is used in applications where users need to select from a range of text-based options or enter custom input.

### When to Use

Consider using a combobox when you have five or more options to present, and users may benefit from the ability to search or input a custom value that is not in the predefined list.

### Interaction / Behavior

- **Opening Options**: When the user clicks on the input area, a dropdown menu of options appears. Users can either scroll through the options, type to filter them, or input a new value directly.
- **Selecting an Option**: Once an option is selected or a custom value is entered, the dropdown closes, and the input field displays the chosen value.
- **Keyboard Support**: Combobox supports navigation using keyboard input, including arrow keys to navigate the list and Enter to make a selection.
