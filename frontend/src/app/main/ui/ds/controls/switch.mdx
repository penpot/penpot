# Switch

The `switch*` component is a toggle control that allows users to switch between two mutually exclusive options.

<Canvas of={Switch.Default} />

## Anatomy

The switch component consists of three main parts:

- **Label** (optional): text that describes what the switch controls
- **Track**: the pill-shaped background that indicates the current state
- **Thumb**: the circular knob that moves between positions

## Accesibility

When no visible label is provided, use `aria-label` for accessibility.

## Variants

### With Label

```clj
[:> switch* {:label "Toggle dark mode"
             :default-checked false}]
```

<Canvas of={Switch.WithLabel} />

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- For binary settings that take effect immediately
- In preference panels and configuration screens

### When Not to Use

- For actions that require confirmation (use buttons instead)
- For multiple choice selections (use radio buttons or select)
- For temporary states that need explicit "Apply" action
