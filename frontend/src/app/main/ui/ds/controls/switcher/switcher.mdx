# Switcher

The `switcher*` component is a toggle control that allows users to switch between two states (on/off).

<Canvas of={Switcher.Default} />

## Anatomy

The switcher component consists of three main parts:

- **Label** (optional): Text that describes what the switcher controls
- **Track**: The pill-shaped background that indicates the current state
- **Thumb**: The circular knob that moves between positions


## Variants

### Different Sizes

The switcher supports three size variants: `"sm"`, `"md"` (default), and `"lg"`.

```clj
[:> switcher* {:size "sm" :label "Small"}]
[:> switcher* {:size "md" :label "Medium"}]
[:> switcher* {:size "lg" :label "Large"}]
```

### Without Visible Label

When no visible label is provided, use `aria-label` for accessibility.

```clj
[:> switcher* {:aria-label "Toggle dark mode"
               :default-checked false}]
```

<Canvas of={Switcher.WithoutVisibleLabel} />

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- For binary settings that take effect immediately
- In preference panels and configuration screens

### When Not to Use

- For actions that require confirmation (use buttons instead)
- For multiple choice selections (use radio buttons or select)
- For temporary states that need explicit "Apply" action
