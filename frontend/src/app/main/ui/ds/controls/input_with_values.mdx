# InputWithValues

The `input-with-values*` acts as an input with an optional addition of a series of values that are only indicators, and an event which is triggered when the focus is lost.

<Canvas of={InputWithValuesStories.Default} />

## Technical notes

* You need to pass the mandatory string property `name`.
* You can pass the optional string property `values`.
* You can pass a function property `on-blur` that will be called with the blur event when the component loses focus (including when the user presses enter or esc).

```clj
[:> input-with-values*
  {:name name
  :values values
  :on-blur on-blur}]
```

## Usage guidelines (design)

### When to use

When we have an element that can be editable, but doesn't change its appearance on hover, and adds an extra set of values that aren't editable (they're just indicators).

### Interaction / Behavior

* The component starts on "display" mode, showing the name and the values.
* Once the user clicks on it, the input goes into "active" mode and the only thing that remains and can be editable is the name (the values are hidden).
* If the user presses enter or esc, the component goes back to "display" mode.
