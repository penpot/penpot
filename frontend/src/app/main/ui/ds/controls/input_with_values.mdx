# InputWithValues

The `input-with-values*` acts as an input with an addition of a series of values that are only indicators.

<Canvas of={InputWithValuesStories.Default} />


## Technical notes

* You need to pass the mandatory string properties `name` and `values`
* You can pass a function property `on-blur` that will be called with the new value when the component lost focus (including when the user press enter or esc)

```clj
[:> input-with-values*
  {:name name
  :values values
  :on-blur on-blur}]
```


## Usage guidelines (design)


### When to use

When we have an element that need to be editable, and an extra set of values that aren't editables and are only indicators


### Interaction / Behavior
* The component starts on "display" mode, showing the name and the values
* Once the user clicks on it, the input goes into "active" mode and the only thing that remains and that is editable is the name (the values are hidden)
* If the user press enter or esc, the component goes back to "display" mode
