# Tooltip

A tooltip is a floating text area that provides helpful or contextual information on hover and focus.

<Canvas of={Tooltip.Default} />

## Technical notes

The tooltip component accepts a `placement` prop that defines the preferred position of the tooltip relative to its trigger. Possible values are:

```
"top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right" | "top-right" | "bottom-right" | "bottom-left" | "top-left"
```
The component will attempt to use the specified `placement` but may fall back to others if there isn’t enough space.
If `placement` is not provided, the tooltip will default to "top".

```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.tooltip.tooltip :as tlp])

   [:> tlp/tooltip* {:id "test-tooltip"
                     :placement "bottom"
                     :content "Tooltip content"}
   [:div  "Trigger component"]])
```

Tooltip content can include HTML elements:
```clj
(ns app.main.ui.foo
  (:require
   [app.main.ui.ds.tooltip.tooltip :as tlp])

   [:> tlp/tooltip* {:id "test-tooltip"
                     :placement "bottom"
                     :content (mf/html [:span "Tooltip content"])}
   [:div  "Trigger component"]])
```

### Accessibility

The tooltip requires an `id` prop, which is used to associate the trigger with the tooltip content via the `aria-describedby` attribute.
This ensures screen readers can announce the tooltip content when the trigger is focused.

Tooltips should not contain interactive elements like buttons, links, or form inputs, since users cannot interact with them via mouse or keyboard.


## Usage guidelines (design)
### Where to use

Use a tooltip as a way for users to see more information before they select an element, go to a new page, or trigger an action on the page.

### When to use

- When users need help making a decision
- When you need to provide more information for icons or icon buttons without labels
- When you need to define new or unfamiliar UI elements that are not described directly in the user interface

### Interaction / Behaviour

Tooltips are triggered on hover or keyboard focus

They automatically disappear on mouse leave or blur

Tooltip positioning is dynamically adjusted to stay within the viewport

A small delay is applied before showing the tooltip to avoid accidental triggers, the duration of this delay is configurable by default it is 300ms.
