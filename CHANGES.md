### :boom: Breaking changes & Deprecations

- The `PENPOT_LOGIN_WITH_LDAP` environment variable is finally removed (after
  many version with deprecation). It is replaced with the
  `enable-login-with-ldap` flag.
- The `PENPOT_LDAP_ATTRS_PHOTO` finally removed, it was unused for many
  versions.
- If you are using social login (google, github, gitlab or generic OIDC) you
  will need to ensure to add the following flags respectively to let them
  enabled: `enable-login-with-google`, `enable-login-with-github`,
  `enable-login-with-gitlab` and `enable-login-with-oidc`. If not, they will
  remain disabled after application start independently if you set the client-id
  and client-sectet options.
- The `PENPOT_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` is finally removed in favour of
  `<enable|disable>-registration` flag.
- The OIDC providers are now initialized synchronously, and if you are using the
  discovery mechanism of the generic OIDC integration, the start time of the
  application will depend on how fast the OIDC provider responds to the
  discovery http request.

  configuration added scopes to the default set. Now it replaces it, so use with care, because
  penpot requires at least `name` and `email` props found on the user info object.
