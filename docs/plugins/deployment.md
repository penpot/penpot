# Deployment

When it comes to deploying your plugin there are several platforms to choose from. Each platform has its unique features and benefits, so the choice depends on you.

In this guide you will found some options for static sites that have free plans.

## 3.1. Building your project

The building may vary between frameworks but if you had previously configured your scripts in <code class="language-bash">package.json</code>, <code class="language-bash">npm run build</code> should work.

The resulting build should be located somewhere in the <code class="language-bash">dist/</code> folder, maybe somewhere else if you have configured so.

Be wary that some framework's builders can add additional folders like <code class="language-bash">apps/project-name/</code>, <code class="language-bash">project-name/</code> or <code class="language-bash">browser/</code>.

Examples:

## 3.2. Netlify

### Create an account

You need a Netlify account if you don't already have one. You can <a target="_blank" href="https://app.netlify.com/signup">sign up</a> with Github, GItlab, BItbucket or via email and password.

### CORS issues

To avoid these issues you can add a <code class="language-bash">_headers</code> file to your plugin. Place it in the <code class="language-bash">public/</code> folder or alongside the main files.

```js
/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### Connect to Git

Netlify allows you to import an existing project from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Azure DevOps.

    <source src="/img/plugins/deploy-netlify-repo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

1. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://app.netlify.com/start">Start</a> and connect with your repository. Allow Netlify to be installed in either all your projects or just the selected ones.

2. Configure your build settings. Netlify auto-detects your framework and offers a basic configuration. This is usually enough.

3. Deploy your plugin.

### Drag and drop

Netlify offers a simple drag and drop method. Check <a target="_blank" href="https://app.netlify.com/drop">Netlify Drop</a>.

1. Build your project

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://app.netlify.com/drop">Netlify Drop</a>.

4. Done!

## 3.3. Cloudflare

### Create an account

You need a Cloudflare account if you don't already have one. You can <a target="_blank" href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">sign up</a> via email and password.

```js
/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### CORS issues

To avoid these issues you can add a <code class="language-bash">CORS</code> file to your plugin. Place it in the <code class="language-bash">public/</code> folder or alongside the main files.

The <code class="language-bash">CORS</code> can contain a <code class="language-bash">*</code> for any domain, or a list of specific domains.

Check <a target="_blank" href="https://surge.sh/help/enabling-cross-origin-resource-sharing">Enabling Cross-Origin Resources sharing</a>.

### How to deploy

1. Install surge CLI globally and log into your account or create one.

```bash
npm install --global surge
surge login
# or
surge signup
```

2. Create a CORS file to allow all sites.

```bash
echo '*' > public/CORS
```

3. Build your project.

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start surge deployment

```bash
surge

# Your plugin build folder
project: /home/user/example-plugin/dist/

# your domain, surge offers a free .surge.sh domain and free ssl
domain: https://example-plugin-penpot.surge.sh

upload: [====================] 100% eta: 0.0s (10 files, 305761 bytes)
