<h3 id="file-libraries">File libraries</h3>
<p>Each file has its own file library which is where the assets that belong to this file are stored.</p>
<p>You have two ways to access the file library from the file <a href="/user-guide/first-steps/the-interface/#interface-workspace">workspace</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the assets tab icon at the left sidebar.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Alt/‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shared-libraries">Shared libraries</h3>
<h4>Publish as shared library</h4>
<p>You can publish any regular file as a shared library. This means that the file library of this file will be available to be connected to other files that exist in the same team, so its library assets can be reused.</p>
<p>There are two ways to publish a library:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the file main menu.</li>
  <li>From the libraries panel, that you can launch by clicking on the "Libraries" button that is found at the assets tab.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unpublish a shared library</h4>
<p>You can unpublish any library anytime the same way you can publish it, both from the file menu and the libraries panel.</p>
<p>Unpublishing a library will disconnect it from the files where it was connected. The assets that have already been used in other files will remain, but no longer linked with the now unpublished library.</p>

<h4>Library updates</h4>

<h4>Connect shared libraries</h4>
<p>To add a Shared Library from another file, launch the libraries panel, then search and select the available libraries. If you see the message "There are no Shared Libraries available", start by <a href="/user-guide/design-systems/libraries/#shared-libraries">publishing other files as a shared library</a> or add from our <a href="https://penpot.app/libraries-templates">Libraries & templates</a>.</p>
