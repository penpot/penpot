<h1 id="layer-basics">Layer basics</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">Every object you create in Penpot’s <a href="/user-guide/workspace-basics/#viewport">viewport</a> is a layer. Rectangles, ellipses, boards or text boxes are layers that you can use to build your design.</p>

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Pages allow you to organize layers into separate sections inside a file, and are shown in separate tabs. Subdividing a file into pages gives you the ability to split your file into logically different sections so that you can organise your work. For instance, you can use pages to separate stages of the design process but keep them in the same document. Different screen sizes, features or atomic design categories are other common ways to use pages. </p>

<p>You can add, remove or rename pages to suit your needs.</p>

<h2 id="layers-panel">Layers panel</h2>
<p><strong>Layers:</strong> Layers are the different objects that you can place at the design viewport. At the layers panel you can see all the layers of a file page. Drag the layers to arrange them to different positions.</p>

<h2 id="boolean-operators">Boolean operators</h2>
<p>It is possible to combine shapes in a group in different ways to create more complex objects by using
"boolean" operators. Boolean operators are non destructive and the original shapes remain grouped and available for more editing. There are five boolean operations available: union, difference, intersection, exclusion and flatten. Using boolean operations allows many graphic options and possibilities for your designs.</p>

  </video>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Union:</strong> the resulting combination is the sum of the shapes.</li>
  <li><strong>Difference:</strong> the opposite of union, the resulting object has the area of the shape on top has been cut out from the shape at the bottom.</li>
  <li><strong>Intersection:</strong> creates a group whose shape is the overlapping area between the shapes.</li>
  <li><strong>Exclusion:</strong> the opposite of intersection, the resulting shape is the area that does not overlap between the shapes.</li>
  <li><strong>Flatten:</strong> Tecnically not a boolean operator, this is the way to permanently combine the paths of a group of shapes in a single one.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="constraints">Resizing constraints</h2>
<p>Constraints allow you to decide how layers will behave when resizing its container.</p>

<h3>Apply constraints</h3>
<p>Constraints allow you to decide how layers will behave when resizing its parent container. You can apply horizontal and vertical constraints for every layer.</p>
<p>To apply constraints select a layer and use the constraints map or the constraints selectors at the design panel.</p>
<figure>

<p>Constraints are set to “Scale” by default, but you have other options.</p>

<h3>Horizontal constraints</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Left</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the left side of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Right</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the right side of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Left & right</strong>: The object resizes while maintaining its distance to both horizontal sides of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Center</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the horizontal center of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale</strong>: The object will horizontally resize proportionally to its parent container size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vertical constraints</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Top</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the top side of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the bottom side of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Top & bottom</strong>: The object resizes while maintaining its distance to both vertical sides of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Center</strong>: The object maintains its size and position relative to the vertical center of its parent container.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale</strong>: The object will vertically resize proportionally to its parent container size.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="focus-mode">Focus mode</h2>
<p>Select the elements of a page you want to work with in a specific moment hiding the rest so they don’t get in the way of your attention. This option is also useful to improve the performance in cases where the page has a large number of elements.</p>
<p>To activate focus mode:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select one or more elements.</li>
  <li>Right click to show the menu and select the option "Focus on" or press <kbd>F</kbd>.</li>

<h2 id="rtl-support">RTL support</h2>
<p>Diversity and inclusion is a major Penpot concern and that's why we love to give support to RTL languages, unlike most design tools.</p>
<p>If you write in arabic, hebrew or other RTL language text direction will be automatically detected in text layers.</p>
