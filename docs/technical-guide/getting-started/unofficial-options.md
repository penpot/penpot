# Unofficial self-host options

There are some other options, **NOT SUPPORTED BY PENPOT**:

* Install with <a href="https://community.penpot.app/t/how-to-develop-penpot-with-podman-penpotman/2113" target="_blank">Podman</a> instead of Docker.
* Try the under development <a href="https://github.com/author-more/penpot-desktop/releases/latest" target="_blank">Penpot Desktop app</a>.
* Try a simple Kubernetes Deployment option <a href="https://github.com/degola/penpot-kubernetes" target="_blank">penpot-kubernetes</a>.
* Penpot is available <a href="https://apps.yunohost.org/app/penpot">in the catalog</a> of apps installable on YunoHost instances.
* Or try a fully manual installation if you have a really specific use case.. For help, you can look at the [Architecture][1] section and the <a href="https://github.com/penpot/penpot/tree/develop/docker/images" target="_blank">Docker configuration files</a>.
