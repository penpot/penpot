# Self-hosting Guide

This guide explains how to get your own Penpot instance, running on a machine you control,
to test it, use it by you or your team, or even customize and extend it any way you like.

If you need more context you can look at the <a
href="https://community.penpot.app/t/self-hosting-penpot-i/2336" target="_blank">post
about self-hosting</a> in Penpot community.

**There is absolutely no difference between <a
href="https://design.penpot.app">our SaaS offer</a> for Penpot and your
self-hosted Penpot platform!**

There are three main options for creating a Penpot instance:

1. Using the platform of our partner <a href="https://elest.io/open-source/penpot" target="_blank">Elestio</a>.
2. Using <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> tool.
3. Using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>.

<p class="advice">
The recommended way is to use Elestio, since it's simpler, fully automatic and still greatly flexible.
Use Docker if you already know the tool, if need full control of the process or have extra requirements
and do not want to depend on any external provider, or need to do any special customization.
