# Technical Guide

## Self-hosting Penpot

This section details everything you need to know to get Penpot up and running in your own
machine.

* In the [Install with Elestio][1] section, you can find how to open an Elestio account and create your Penpot instance.

* In the [Install with Docker][2] section, you can find the official Docker installation guide.

* In the [Configuration][3] section, you can find all the customization options you can set up after installing.

* Or you can try other, not supported by Penpot, [Unofficial options][4].

## Integration with external apps

The [Integration Guide][5] explains how to connect Penpot with external apps, so they get notified
when certain events occur and may create your own interconnections and collaboration features.
## Developing Penpot

Also, if you are a developer, you can get into the code, to explore it, learn how it is made, or extend it and contribute with new functionality. For this, we have a different Docker installation.
In the [Developer Guide][6] you can find how to setup a development environment and many other dev-oriented documentation.
