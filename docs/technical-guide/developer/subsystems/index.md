# Penpot subsystems

This section groups articles about several Penpot subsystems that have enough
complexity not to be easy to understand by only looking at the source code.

Each article gives an overview of how a particular functionality has been
implemented, over the whole app (backend, frontend or exporter), and points to
the most relevant source files to look at to start exploring it. When some
special considerations are needed (performance questions, limits, common
"gotchas", historic reasons of some decisions, etc.) they are also noted.
