title: 3.07. Abstraction levels

# Code organization in abstraction levels

Initially, Penpot data model implementation was organized in a different way.
We are currently in a process of reorganization. The objective is to have data
manipulation code structured in abstraction layers, with well-defined
boundaries, and a hierarchical structure (each level may only use same or
lower levels, but not higher).

![Abstraction levels](/img/abstraction-levels/abstraction-levels.png)

At this moment the namespace structure is already organized as described here,
but there is much code that does not comply with these rules, and needs to be
moved or refactored. We expect to be refactoring existing modules incrementally,
each time we do an important functionality change.

## Basic data

```text
▾ common/
  ▾ src/app/common/
      data.cljc
      ▾ src/app/data/
          macros.cljc
```

A level for generic data structures or operations, that are not specifically part
of the domain model (e.g. trees, strings, maps, iterators, etc.). Also may belong
here some functions in <code>app.common.geom/</code> and <code>app.common.files.helpers.cljc</code>.

We need to create a new directory for this and move there all functions in this
leve.


## Abstract data types

```text
▾ common/
  ▾ src/app/common/
    ▾ types/
        file.cljc
        page.cljc
        shape.cljc
        color.cljc
        component.cljc
        tokens_lib.cljc
        ...
```

Namespaces here represent a single data entity of the domain model, or a
fragment of one, as an [Abstract Data Type](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/).
An ADT is a data component that is defined through a series of properties and
operations, and that abstracts out the details of how it's implemented and what
is the internal structure. This allows to simplify the logic of the client
code, and also to make future changes in the ADT without affecting callers (if
the abstract interface does not change).

Each structure in this module has:

* A **schema spec** that defines the structure of the type and its values:

     ```clojure
     (def schema:fill
       [:map {:title "Fill"}
        [:fill-color {:optional true} ::ctc/rgb-color]
        [:fill-opacity {:optional true} ::sm/safe-number]
        ...)

     (def schema:shape-base-attrs
       [:map {:title "ShapeMinimalRecord"}
        [:id ::sm/uuid]
        [:name :string]
        [:type [::sm/one-of shape-types]]
        [:selrect ::grc/rect]
        [:points schema:points]
        ...)

      (def schema:token-set-attrs
        [:map {:title "TokenSet"}
         [:name :string]
         [:description {:optional true} :string]
         [:modified-at {:optional true} ::sm/inst]
         [:tokens {:optional true} [:and
                                     [:map-of {:gen/max 5}
                                              :string
                                              schema:token]
                                     [:fn d/ordered-map?]]]])
     ```

* A **protocol** that define the external interface to be used for this entity.

    (NOTE: this is currently only implemented in some subsystems like Design Tokens
     and new path handling).

    ```clojure
    (defprotocol ITokenSet
      (update-name [_ set-name] "change a token set name while keeping the path")
      (add-token [_ token] "add a token at the end of the list")
      (update-token [_ token-name f] "update a token in the list")
      (delete-token [_ token-name] "delete a token from the list")
      (get-token [_ token-name] "return token by token-name")
      (get-tokens [_] "return an ordered sequence of all tokens in the set"))
    ```

* A **custom data type** that implements this protocol. __Functions here are the only
  ones allowed to modify the internal structure of the type__.

    Clojure allows us two kinds of custom data types:
     * [**`deftype`**](https://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/#deftype). We'll
       use it when we want the internal structure to be completely opaque and
       data accessed through protocol functions. Clojure allows access to the
       attributes with the <code class="language-clojure">(.-attr)</code>
       syntax, but we prefer not to use it.
     * [**`defrecord`**](https://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/#defrecord).
       We'll use it when we want the structure to be exposed as a plain clojure
       map, and thus allowing to read attributes with <code
       class="language-clojure">(:attr t)</code>, to use <code
       class="language-clojure">get</code>, <code
       class="language-clojure">keys</code>, <code
       class="language-clojure">vals</code>, etc. Note that this also allows
       modifying the object with <code class="language-clojure">assoc</code>,
       <code class="language-clojure">update</code>, etc. But in general we
       prefer to do all modification via protocol methods, because this way
       it's easier to track down where the failure is if an invalid structure
       is detected in a validation check, and add business logic like "update
       <code class="language-clojure">modified-at</code> whenever any other
       attribute is changed".

    ```clojure
    (defrecord TokenSet [name description modified-at tokens]
      ITokenSet
      (add-token [_ token]
        (let [token (check-token token)]
          (TokenSet. name
                     description
                     (dt/now)
                     (assoc tokens (:name token) token))))
    ```


* **Additional helper functions** the protocol should be made as small and compact
  as possible. If we need functions for business logic or complex queries that
  do not need to directly access the internal structure, but can be implemented by
  only calling the abstract procotol, they should be created as standalone functions.
  At this level, they must be functions that operate only on instances of the given
  domain model entity. They must always ensure the internal integrity of the data.

    ```clojure
    (defn sets-tree-seq
      "Get tokens sets tree as a flat list"
      [token-sets]
      ...)

> IMPORTANT SUMMARY
>  * Code in this level only knows about one domain model entity.
>  * All functions ensure the internal integrity of the data.
>  * For this, the schema is used, and the functions must check parameters
>    and output values as needed.
>  * No outside code should get any knowledge of the internal structure, so it
>    can be changed in the future without breaking cliente code.
>  * All modifications of the data should be done via protocol methods (even in
>    <code class="language-clojure">defrecords</code>). This allows a) more
>    control of the internal data dependencies, b) easier bug tracking of
>    corrupted data, and c) easier refactoring when the structure is modified.

Currently most of Penpot code does not follow those requirements, but it
should do in new code or in any refactor.

## File operations

```text
▾ common/
  ▾ src/app/common/
    ▾ files/
        helpers.cljc
        shapes_helpers.cljc
        ...
```

Functions that modify a file object (or a part of it) in place, returning the
file object changed. They ensure the referential integrity within the file, or
between a file and its libraries.

**These functions are used when we need to manipulate objects of different
domain entities inside a file.**

```clojure
(defn resolve-component
  "Retrieve the referenced component, from the local file or from a library"
  [shape file libraries & {:keys [include-deleted?] :or {include-deleted? False}}]
  (if (= (:component-file shape) (:id file))
        (ctkl/get-component (:data file) (:component-id shape) include-deleted?)
        (get-component libraries
                      (:component-file shape)
                      (:component-id shape)
                      :include-deleted? include-deleted?)))

(defn delete-component
  "Mark a component as deleted and store the main instance shapes iside it, to
  be able to be recovered later."
  [file-data component-id skip-undelete? delta]
  (let [delta (or delta (gpt/point 0 0))]
    (if skip-undelete?
      (ctkl/delete-component file-data component-id)
      (-> file-data
          (ctkl/update-component component-id #(load-component-objects file-data % delta))
          (ctkl/mark-component-deleted component-id)))))
```

> This module is still needing an important refactor. Mainly to take functions
> from common.types and move them here.

### File validation and repair

There is a function in <code class="language-clojure">app.common.files.validate</code> that checks a file for
referential and semantic integrity. It's called automatically when file changes
are sent to backend, but may be invoked manually whenever it's needed.

## File changes objects

```text
▾ common/
  ▾ src/app/common/
    ▾ files/
        changes_builder.cljc
        changes.cljc
        ...
```

This layer is how we adopt the [Event sourcing pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/event-sourcing-pattern/).
Instead of directly modifying files, we create <code class="language-clojure">changes</code>
objects, that represent one modification, and that can be serialized, stored,
send to backend, logged, etc. Then it can be *materialized* by a **processing
function**, that takes a file and a change, and returns the updated file.

This also allows an important feature: undoing changes.

Processing functions should not contain business logic or algorithms. Just
adapt the change interface to the operations in **File** or **Abstract Data
Types** levels.

There exists a <code class="language-clojure">changes-builder</code> module
with helper functions to conveniently build changes objects, and to
automatically calculate the reverse undo change.

> IMPORTANT RULES
>
> All changes must satisfy two properties:
> * **[Idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)**. The event
>   sourcing architecture and multiuser capability may cause that the same
>   change may be applied more than once to a file. So changes must not, for
>   example, be like *increment counter* but rather *set counter to value x*.
> * **Minimal scope**. To reduce conflicts, changes should only modify the
>   relevant part of the domain entity. This way, if a concurrent change on
>   the same entity arrives, from another user, and it modifies a different
>   part of the data, they may ve processed without overriding.

## Business logic

```text
▾ common/
  ▾ src/app/common/
    ▾ logic/
        shapes.cljc
        libraries.cljc
```

At this level there are functions that implement high level user actions, in an
abstract way (independent of UI). Here may be complex business logic (eg. to
create a component copy we must clone all shapes, assign new ids, relink
parents, change the head structure to be a copy and link each shape in the copy
with the corresponding one in the main).

They don't directly modify files, but generate changes objects, that may be
executed in frontend or sent to backend.

Those functions may also be composed in even higher level actions. For example
a "update shape attr" action may use "unapply token" actions when the attribute
has an applied token.

```clojure
(defn generate-instantiate-component
  "Generate changes to create a new instance from a component."
  ([changes objects file-id component-id position page libraries]
   (generate-instantiate-component changes objects file-id component-id position page libraries nil nil nil {}))
  ([changes objects file-id component-id position page libraries old-id parent-id frame-id
    {:keys [force-frame?]
     :or {force-frame? false}}]
   (let [component     (ctf/get-component libraries file-id component-id)
         library       (get libraries file-id)
         parent        (when parent-id (get objects parent-id))

         [...]

         [new-shape new-shapes]
         (ctn/make-component-instance page
                                      component
                                      (:data library)
                                      position
                                      (cond-> {}
                                        force-frame?
                                        (assoc :force-frame-id frame-id)))

         [...]

         changes
         (reduce #(pcb/add-object %1 %2 {:ignore-touched true})
                 changes
                 (rest new-shapes))]

     [new-shape changes])))
```

## Data events

```text
▾ frontend/
  ▾ src/app/main/data/
    ▾ dashboard/
    ▾ viewer/
    ▾ workspace/
```

This is the intersection of the logic and the presentation in Penpot. Data
events belong to the presentation interface and they manage the global state of
the application. But they may also work on loaded files by using **File** or
**Abstract Data Types** operations to query the data, and by creating and
commiting **changes** via the **Business logic** generate functions.

**IMPORTANT: data events must not contain business logic theirselves**, or
directly manipulate data structures. They only may modify or query the global
state, and delegate all logic to lower level functions.

In current Penpot code, there is some quantity of business logic in data events,
that should be progressively moved elsewhere as we keep refactoring.

```clojure
(defn detach-component
  "Remove all references to components in the shape with the given id,
  and all its children, at the current page."
  [id]
  (dm/assert! (uuid? id))
  (ptk/reify ::detach-component
    ptk/WatchEvent
    (watch [it state _]
      (let [page-id   (:current-page-id state)
            file-id   (:current-file-id state)

            fdata     (dsh/lookup-file-data state file-id)
            libraries (dsh/lookup-libraries state)

            changes   (-> (pcb/empty-changes it)
                          (cll/generate-detach-component id fdata page-id libraries))]

        (rx/of (dch/commit-changes changes))))))
```
