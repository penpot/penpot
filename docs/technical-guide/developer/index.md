# Developer Guide

This section is intended for people wanting to mess with the code or the inners
of Penpot application.

The [Architecture][1] and [Data model][2] sections provide a bird's eye view of
the whole system, to better understand how is structured.

The [Dev Env][3] section explains how to setup the development enviroment that
we (the core team) use internally.

And the rest of sections are a list categorized of probably not deeply
related HOWTO articles about dev-centric subjects.
