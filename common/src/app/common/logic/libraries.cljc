;; ---- Component synchronization helpers ----

;; Three sources of component synchronization:
;;
;;  - NORMAL SYNC: when a component is updated, any shape that use it,
;;    must be synchronized. All attributes that have changed in the
;;    component and whose attr group has not been "touched" in the dest
;;    shape are copied.
;;
;;      generate-sync-shape-direct (reset = false)
;;
;;  - FORCED SYNC: when the "reset" command is applied to some shape,
;;    all attributes that have changed in the component are copied, and
;;    the "touched" flags are cleared.
;;
;;      generate-sync-shape-direct (reset = true)
;;
;;  - INVERSE SYNC: when the "update component" command is used in some
;;    shape, all the attributes that have changed in the shape are copied
;;    into the linked component. The "touched" flags are also cleared in
;;    the origin shape.
;;
;;      generate-sync-shape-inverse
;;
;;  The initial shape is always a group (a root instance), so all the
;;  children are recursively synced, too. A root instance is a group shape
;;  that has the "component-id" attribute and also "component-root?" is true.
;;
;;  The children lists of the instance and the component shapes are compared
;;  side-by-side. Any new, deleted or moved child modifies (and "touches")
;;  the parent shape.
;;
;;  When a shape inside a component is in turn an instance of another
;;  component, the synchronization is more complex:
;;
;;    [Page]
;;    Instance-2         #--> Component-2          (#--> = root instance)
;;      IShape-2-1        -->   Shape-2-1          (@--> = nested instance)
;;      Subinstance-2-2  @-->   Component-1        ( --> = shape ref)
;;        IShape-2-2-1    -->     Shape-1-1
;;
;;    [Component-1]
;;    Component-1
;;      Shape-1-1
;;
;;    [Component-2]
;;    Component-2
;;      Shape-2-1
;;      Subcomponent-2-2 @--> Component-1
;;        Shape-2-2-1     -->   Shape-1-1
;;
;;   * A SUBINSTANCE ACTUALLY HAS TWO MAINS. For example IShape-2-2-1
;;     depends on Shape-2-2-1 (in the "near" component) but also on
;;     Shape-1-1-1 (in the "remote" component). The "shape-ref" attribute
;;     always refer to the remote shape, and it's guaranteed that it's
;;     always a final shape, not an instance. The relationship between the
;;     shape and the near shape is that both point to the same remote.
;;
;;   * THE INITIAL VALUE of IShape-2-2-1 comes from the near component
;;     Shape-2-2-1 (although the shape-ref attribute points to the direct
;;     component Shape-1-1). The touched flags of IShape-2-2-1 start
;;     cleared at first, and activate on any attribute change onwards.
;;
;;   * IN A NORMAL SYNC, the sync process starts in the root instance and
;;     continues recursively with the children of the root instance and
;;     the component. Therefore, IShape-2-2-1 is synced with Shape-2-2-1.
;;
;;   * IN A FORCED SYNC, IF THE INITIAL SHAPE IS THE ROOT INSTANCE, the
;;     order is the same, and IShape-2-2-1 is reset from Shape-2-2-1 and
;;     marked as not touched.
;;
;;   * IF THE INITIAL SHAPE IS THE SUBINSTANCE, the sync is done against
;;     the remote component. Therefore, IShape-2-2-1 is synched with
;;     Shape-1-1. Then the "touched" flags are reset, and the
;;     "remote-synced" flag is set (it will be set until the shape is
;;     touched again or it's synced forced normal or inverse with the
;;     near component).
;;
;;   * IN AN INVERSE SYNC, IF THE INITIAL SHAPE IS THE ROOT INSTANCE, the
;;     order is the same as in the normal sync. Therefore, IShape-2-2-1
;;     values are copied into Shape-2-2-1, and then its touched flags are
;;     cleared. Then, the "touched" flags THAT ARE TRUE are copied to
;;     Shape-2-2-1. This may cause that Shape-2-2-1 is now touched respect
;;     to Shape-1-1, and so, some attributes are not copied in a subsequent
;;     normal sync. Or, if "remote-synced" flag is set in IShape-2-2-1,
;;     all touched flags are cleared in Shape-2-2-1 and "remote-synced"
;;     is removed.
;;
;;   * IN AN INVERSE SYNC INITIATED IN THE SUBINSTANCE, the update is done
;;     to the remote component. E.g. IShape-2-2-1 attributes are copied into
;;     Shape-1-1, and then touched cleared and "remote-synced" flag set.
;;
;;     #### WARNING: there are two conditions that are invisible to user:
;;       - When the near shape (Shape-2-2-1) is touched respect the remote
;;         one (Shape-1-1), there is no asterisk displayed anywhere.
;;       - When the instance shape (IShape-2-2-1) is synced with the remote
;;         shape (remote-synced = true), the user will see that this shape
;;         is different than the one in the near component (Shape-2-2-1)
;;         but it's not touched.
