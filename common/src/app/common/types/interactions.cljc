;; WARNING: options are not deleted when changing event or action type, so it can be
;;          restored if the user changes it back later.
;;
;;          But that means that an interaction may have for example a delay or
;;          destination, even if its type does not require it (but a previous type did).
;;
;;          So make sure to use has-delay/has-destination... functions, or similar,
;;          before reading them.
