;; There are some shapes that admit border radius, as rectangles
;; frames components and images. 
;; Those shapes may define the radius of the corners with four values:
;; One for each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left)
;; has an independent value. SVG does not allow this directly, so we
;; emulate it with paths.

;; All operations take into account that the shape may not be a one of those
;; shapes that has border radius, and so it hasn't :r1.
;; In this case operations must leave shape untouched.
