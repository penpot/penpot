;; The default behavior when a user interacts with penpot and runtime
;; and global features:
;;
;; - If user enables on runtime a frontend-only feature, this feature
;;   and creates and/or modifies files, the feature is only availble
;;   until next refresh (it is not persistent)
;;
;; - If user enables on runtime a non-migration feature, on modifying
;;   a file or creating a new one, the feature becomes persistent on
;;   the file and the team. All the other files of the team eventually
;;   will have that feature assigned (on file modification)
;;
;; - If user enables on runtime a migration feature, that feature will
;;   be ignored until a migration is explicitly executed or team
;;   explicitly marked with that feature.
;;
;; The features stored on the file works as metadata information about
;; features enabled on the file and for compatibility check when a
;; user opens the file. The features stored on global, runtime or team
;; works as activators.
