   ;; Extract some attributes of a list of shapes.
   ;; For each attribute, if the value is the same in all shapes,
   ;; wll take this value. If there is any shape that is different,
   ;; the value of the attribute will be the keyword :multiple.
   ;;
   ;; If some shape has the value nil in any attribute, it's
   ;; considered a different value. If the shape does not contain
   ;; the attribute, it's ignored in the final result.

   ;; Example:
   ;;   (def shapes [{:stroke-color "#ff0000"
   ;;                 :stroke-width 3
