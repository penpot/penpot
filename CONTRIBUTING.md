# Contributing Guide #

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Penpot. This is a
generic guide that details how to contribute to Penpot in a way that
is efficient for everyone. If you want a specific documentation for
different parts of the platform, please refer to `docs/` directory.


## Reporting Bugs ##

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/issues)
for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it
clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new
task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

If you found a bug, please report it, as far as possible with:

- a detailed explanation of steps to reproduce the error
- a browser and the browser version used
- a dev tools console exception stack trace (if it is available)

If you found a bug that you consider better discuss in private (for
example: security bugs), consider first send an email to
`support@penpot.app`.

**We don't have formal bug bounty program for security reports; this
is an open source application and your contribution will be recognized
in the changelog.**


## Pull requests ##

If you want propose a change or bug fix with the Pull-Request system
firstly you should carefully read the **DCO** section and format your
commits accordingly.

If you intend to fix a bug it's fine to submit a pull request right
away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you're
fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but
want to keep track of the issue.

If you want to implement or start working in a new feature, please
open a **question** / **discussion** issue for it. No pull-request
will be accepted without previous chat about the changes,
independently if it is a new feature, already planned feature or small
quick win.

If is going to be your first pull request, You can learn how from this
free video series:

https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github

We will use the `easy fix` mark for tag for indicate issues that are
easy for beginners.
