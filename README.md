<br />

Penpot is the first **open-source** design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.

Available on browser or self-hosted, Penpot works with open standards like SVG, CSS, HTML and JSON, and it’s free!

The latest updates take Penpot even further. It’s the first design tool to integrate native [design tokens](https://penpot.dev/collaboration/design-tokens)—a single source of truth to improve efficiency and collaboration between product design and development.
With the [huge 2.0 release](https://penpot.app/dev-diaries), Penpot took the platform to a whole new level. This update introduces the ground-breaking [CSS Grid Layout feature](https://penpot.app/penpot-2.0), a complete UI redesign, a new Components system, and much more.
For organizations that need extra service for its teams, [get in touch](https://cal.com/team/penpot/talk-to-us)

🎇 Design, code, and Open Source meet at [Penpot Fest](https://penpot.app/penpotfest)! Be part of the 2025 edition in Madrid, Spain, on October 9-10.

## Why Penpot ##

Penpot expresses designs as code. Designers can do their best work and see it will be beautifully implemented by developers in a two-way collaboration.

### Plugin system ###
[Penpot plugins](https://penpot.app/penpothub/plugins) let you expand the platform's capabilities, give you the flexibility to integrate it with other apps, and design custom solutions.

### Designed for developers ###
Penpot was built to serve both designers and developers and create a fluid design-code process. You have the choice to enjoy real-time collaboration or play "solo".

### Inspect mode ###
Work with ready-to-use code and make your workflow easy and fast. The inspect tab gives instant access to SVG, CSS and HTML code.

### Self host your own instance ###
Provide your team or organization with a completely owned collaborative design tool. Use Penpot's cloud service or deploy your own Penpot server.

### Integrations ###
Penpot offers integration into the development toolchain, thanks to its support for webhooks and an API accessible through access tokens.

###  Building Design Systems: design tokens, components and variants  ###
Penpot brings design systems to code-minded teams: a single source of truth with native Design Tokens, Components, and Variants for scalable, reusable, and consistent UI across projects and platforms.
