## Introduction ##

The open-source solution for design and prototyping. PENPOT is
currently at an early development stage but we are working hard to
bring you the beta version as soon as possible. Follow the project
progress in Twitter or Github and stay tuned!


## SVG based ##

Penpot works with SVG, a standard format, for all your designs and
prototypes . This means that all your stuff in Penpot is portable and
editable in many other vector tools and easy to use on the web.

[See SVG specification](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/)
